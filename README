flckcli is a command line batch uploader for flickr.

= SUMMARY =
This program uploads batches of numbered images to flickr from the command
line.  It takes a start and stop number, a configurable filename format and
directory, allows for some numbers to be missing, like if those numbers were
used for movies as my canon does.  The program outputs information about the
files it has uploaded in yaml to stdout and to a log file.

specify the start and stop number and it will do the rest.

= INSTALL =
  1. copy flckcli.rb into your PATH, probably in /usr/local/bin/
  2. edit ~/.flck.yml and add your api key info in "secret" and "key", and then 
    specify the directory and filename format. mine looks like this...
--- 
:img_dir: ~/img/camera/2009/100canon/
:browser: /usr/bin/firefox
:logyml: ~/.flck-log.yml
:format: img_%04d.jpg
:token: <added by the code >
secret: <get api key+secret from flickr>
key: <get api key+secret from flickr>

  3. 


= USAGE =
$ ./flck.rb 
usage: $0 <start number> <stop number>
$ 

eg:

$ ./flck.rb 6101 6200

img_6108.jpg: { id: 5156133179, elapsed: "51.005421", size: 3602739}
...
and so on

= TODO =
  1. separate token, which is added by code, from the config yml 
  2. allow yml or command line to specify the options to the upload
  3. support other operations
